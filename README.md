# refactored-berkeley-pacman
Is it hubris? maybe. Is the code awful? yes.

This is an attempt at refactoring the Berkeley Pacman project to meet modern standards of project code design. I chose to do this to not only make it easier to run (currently the project doesn't support anything beyond Python 3.7), but also to make it easier to read. The advent of Python typing and the application of better object oriented design will make this code easier to work with, without having to understand all the ins and outs of what makes the game actually run.

### Objectives
There are a few high-level goals I have with this project.

1. 1-click dev environment setup with VS Code.
2. Fully-typed classes.
3. (Still developing these objectives.)
